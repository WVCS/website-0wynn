  <h2>About Me </h2>
  

    <h1> Hello, my name is Owynn Negado and I am a 11th grader at Westview high school. I have two sisters which they attended Westview. Unfortunately I am the middle child of the family, and you know how that goes. I have four dogs, William, Kona, Charlie, and Quinn. They are all Boston Terriers and we have had them since 2016. </h1>
    
    <h3> I have a lot of hobbies I like to do when I am not in school. First, my favorite hobby/sport I love to play is baseball. I have been playing baseball for 11 years ranging from little league to High School. Throughout my journey, I created a lot of memories and friends to this day. Currently, I can play outfield, third base, and second base. Unfortunely, my team didn't go too deep into the playoffs, but I have a feeling that we will win it all next year.  </h3>

    <h4> I also spend my free time hanging out with my friends to typically go to the beach, get food, and at home. Every week, we try to hang out with each other. On most tuesdays, my friends and I would go to BJS to get pazookies. Also, we would try to go to the beach after school when it is hot.  </h4>
